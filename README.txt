In the HW2,I used Python and implemented my codes on Pycharm IDE.
In the question 1:	
	- It takes a little time to run the code. 
	- There are 4 images or plots as the output of question 1. You have to close one in order to see another.
        - I put the plots and images in my report.
        
In question 2: 
	- There are 2 plots as the output. You have to close one in order to see another.
        - I put the plots in my report.
 	- In the console, you can see the coefficients and MSE values of both models (2.3 and 2.4)
In question 3:
	- I implemented both of the models but SGD fails  and runs forever. However the code is present in lines 139-169. 
	- The output represents the metrics of Logistic Regression with full-batch gradient ascent. Later on you can stop the program
	  since it runs forever.
	- I also put my output in my report.

NOTE: In all three questions data is loaded in the for loops at the beggining of the codes(csv.read). you can change the filenames and test them

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
